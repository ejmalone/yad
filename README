This is a simple project built over a few days to test out tech I was unfamiliar or not terribly well versed in.
The idea was to create a modular visualation of log data (HTTP 200s, 5XXs, honeypot hits) and git commits, and offer some basic
alerts when something goes wrong.

Technology used includes

* Node.js
* socket.io
* React
* HTML5 canvas, notification, audio
* Google Maps Javascript API
